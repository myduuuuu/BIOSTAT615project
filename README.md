# BIOSTAT615project
Implementing an SVM Using Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) in C++ and R<br />
Our project is an implementation of an SVM in C++ that solely focuses on classification, and it employs the SMO algorithm based on
the pseudo code provided by John Platt in his original paper. To demonstrate the performance of the SMO algorithm and further
visualize the SVM classification results in a two-dimensional space, we also include a self-developed R package (“Smo615”) that
enables users to graph the training and test data along with the decision boundaries and margin.
