# BIOSTAT615project
Implementing an SVM Using Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) in C++ and R<br />
Our project is an implementation of an SVM in C++ that solely focuses on classification, and it employs the SMO algorithm based on<br />
the pseudo code provided by John Platt in his original paper. To demonstrate the performance of the SMO algorithm and further<br />
visualize the SVM classification results in a two-dimensional space, we also include a self-developed R package (“Smo615”) that<br />
enables users to graph the training and test data along with the decision boundaries and margin.
